1. Connecting a battery to a PN junction diode at forward/reverse bias lowers/increases the barrier voltage, also you might ask why electrons are attracted towards the direction of some holes/postitive charge and the answer is just one word : conduction and valence band energies and structures of different atoms are variable.
