The above repository contains reports and source codes dealing with the problem  "Non-Linearity of an Avalanche Photodiode due to its Multiplication Factor for low power Tranceivers". I have modelled this problem in two ways: Firstly, as a physics problem where I deal with how and why does the photodiode not respond in a linear fashion across a fixed range of input light power, Secondly as a communications problem where I study how the non-linearity of the photodiode affects a VLC system and ways to overcome the problem.



# Notes
1. Connecting a battery to a PN junction diode at forward/reverse bias lowers/increases the barrier voltage, also you might ask why electrons are attracted towards the direction of some holes/postitive charge and the answer is just one word : conduction and valence band energies and structures of different atoms are variable.
2. Forward current is due to recombination and reverse current is due to generation. 
3. Photodiodes are reverse biased because when we shine light, we want the photon to strike the depletion region, which generates electron-hole pairs that can make a difference and cause current, a current whose strength is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light, whereas in the forward bias mode, depletion regions gets narrowed down and a depletion current is observed which is independent of the incident light intensity which breaks our purpose
4. What is saturation of a photodiode?
5. Multiplication factor infleunces the output of APD during when? Seems like a simple question at face value , also what is M0?
